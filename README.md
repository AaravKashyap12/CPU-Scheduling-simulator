# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms and visualizes the process execution using Python and Tkinter.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling

## Features:
- **Gantt Chart Visualization**: Visual representation of the process execution order.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization for each scheduling algorithm.

## Technologies:
- Python (Tkinter for GUI, Matplotlib for Gantt Chart)
- Data Structures for scheduling algorithms

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AaravKashyap12/CPU-Scheduling-simulator.git
